#FEWD Week #3 Project: CSS Layouts

---


###Description


Relaxr was really impressed by your work last week and wants you to continue development on their landing page. Starting in class, you will work to build out a more complex layout for their company site. They decided on creating a blog, and their back-end engineers will be focused on developing the blog's functionality. They want your front-end skills to style their designs using HTML and CSS so Relaxr's engineers can begin integrating. Once again, the designers have handed you a basic design file with instructions and the JPEG below to help you bring the blog to life. Submit the finished version for homework.

Hi Phoebe,
Good work with the assignment, a few issues around the layouting, make sure you let me know if you need some help with making the flexbox stuff make senes :).
Typically better to use downcase folders for the `css` and `images` folders.
Great work with the css, it's looking very clean and organised.
